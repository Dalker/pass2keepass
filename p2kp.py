"""Pass2KeePass - a pass to keepass translator, by Dalker

Goal: Translate a file structure from pass (https://www.passwordstore.org) into
      a portable KeePass file, for use with smartphone clients (that typically allow
      authentication by fingerprint after a *strong* password was input once)

Reason: When looking for a pass-to-keepass exporter, the following was found:
        https://github.com/wichmannpas/pass_to_keepass
        However, it uses a keepassdb that is not available in a working version
        at the time of writing (pip install leads to error and no AUR version
        exists). After trying shortly to adapt a fork of the aforementioned script,
        to the available pykeepass module, it was deemed more reasonable to restart
        from scratch, while keeping the python language and some inspiration from
        the original pass_to_keepass.
        The only portion of code that remains is the one-liner used to read a single
        password from the password store, so that single line retains the copyright
        2016 Pascal Wichmann under Apache License (follow link above), whereas the
        rest of the script is copyright 2022 Daniel Kessler under GPLv2.

Versions: v1.0 (2022-06.18) - first working version, does the basics

TODO: - make async actually do something useful or get rid of it so that progress can
        be shown again in a synchronous way
      - add command-line arguments for export file, subdir(s) and keyfile
      - let user insert master password for exported keepass within password store itself,
        as well as possibly default args for export file, subdir(s) and keyfile
