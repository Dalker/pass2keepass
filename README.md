# pass2keepass
Script to export from password store to keepass

This script is inspired by https://github.com/wichmannpas/pass_to_keepass but uses a different module to generate
the keepass file. Its reason of being is that the keepass module used in Wichmann's pass_to_keepass cannot be installed
in the author's system (even from pip) and is probably deprecated. This script uses https://pykeepass.readthedocs.io/
instead.
